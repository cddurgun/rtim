### Example Usage:
```typescript
const enhancement = await PromptEnhancer.enhance(
  "A sunset over mountains",
  {
    cinematicLevel: 'moderate',
    style: 'cinematic',
    targetLength: 'medium'
  }
)

// Returns:
{
  originalPrompt: "A sunset over mountains",
  enhancedPrompt: "A sunset over mountains, golden hour, wide shot, cinematic lighting, depth of field, 4k quality, sharp focus, professional cinematography",
  improvements: ["Added camera techniques", "Added lighting techniques", "Enhanced with professional cinematography terms"],

### Cost Breakdown:
```typescript
{
  estimatedCost: 200,
  breakdown: {
    modelCost: 200,
    sizeCost: 0,
    durationCost: 0
  },
  alternatives: [
    {
      model: "SORA_2",
      size: "1280x720",

      estimatedCost: 100,
      qualityImpact: "minimal",
      savings: 100,
      savingsPercentage: 50
    }
